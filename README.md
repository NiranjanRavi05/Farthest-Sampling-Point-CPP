# Farthest Sampling Point

The Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm is a method used in computer graphics, computational geometry, and machine learning. It selects a subset of points from a dataset such that the selected points are as far away from each other as possible. FPS is commonly used in tasks like downsampling point clouds or initializing centroids for clustering.

This repository provides an example implementation of the Farthest Point Sampling algorithm
